# Solving Real-World Problems Using Graph Algorithms

### 📘 Course Assignment — KR Mangalam University
 **Title:** Solving Real-World Problems Using Graph Algorithms  
**Marks:** 10  
**Estimated Duration:** 10–12 hours  

---

## 🧭 Overview

This project implements **four real-world problems** using **core graph algorithms** in Python.  
It demonstrates how graph theory powers applications like **social media**, **navigation**, **disaster response**, and **infrastructure planning**.

Each problem models real data as a **graph** (using adjacency lists) and applies an appropriate algorithm for traversal or optimization.  
Performance is evaluated using **execution time**, **memory usage**, and **graph visualization**.

## 🚀 Features

- Implementation of **BFS, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, and Prim’s MST**
- **Graph visualizations** using `networkx` and `matplotlib`
- **Performance profiling** using `time` and `memory_profiler`
- Clear modular code and output formatting
- Summary table comparing algorithms and their real-world uses
